# UnsupervisedXX
A simple Unity application that reads QR codes and sends a go command to QLab to fire a cue that corresponds to the data on the QR code. Should be simple enough to edit the "Logic.cs" file to adapt the project to scan your relevant data and output whatever OSC commands you may need! A built windows EXE exists in the files, but it hasn't been thoroughly tested. Might try and find some time to recreate the application to be directly configurable and more user friendly!
