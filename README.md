# UnsupervisedXX
A simple bit of C# code used to develop a QR code reader that sends a go command to QLab to fire a cue that corresponds to the data on the QR code. Should be simple enough to edit the "Logic.cs" file to adapt the project to scan your relevant data and output whatever OSC commands you may need!  Might try and find some time to recreate the application to be directly configurable and more user friendly! Should be as adding a game object and attaching the script to it, along with a QRController, QRCodeEncodeController and DeviceCamera, and an OSC Out script from the following assets, and attaching them to the correct locations in the inspector!

Uses two assets, OSC simpl (Sixth Sensor) and QR Code Barcode Scanner and Generator (52cwalk) which can be found here:
